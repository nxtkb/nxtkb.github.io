# About NXTKB

## Our Story

At NXTKB, we're passionate about creating the next generation of keyboards that prioritize ergonomics, comfort, and productivity. Our journey began with a simple observation: traditional keyboards force our hands and wrists into unnatural positions that can lead to strain and injury over time.

Determined to create a better solution, our team of engineers, designers, and ergonomics specialists set out to develop split keyboards that truly make a difference in people's lives. The result is our flagship product line, including the Ferris Sweep and Ferris Sweep Pro.

## Our Mission

We believe that everyone deserves a comfortable, healthy computing experience without breaking the bank. Our mission is to make high-quality ergonomic keyboards accessible to professionals, home users, and enthusiasts who spend countless hours at their keyboards.

## Our Values

### Health First
We prioritize ergonomics and health benefits in every design decision, ensuring that comfort is never compromised for performance.

### Innovation
We're committed to pushing the boundaries of mechanical keyboard design while incorporating the latest research in ergonomics and human factors.

### Accessibility
High-quality ergonomic keyboards shouldn't be just for the few. We're dedicated to making our products accessible across different budget ranges.

### Community
We listen to our user community and build products based on real feedback and needs. Your typing experience is our focus.

## The Technology

Our keyboards feature:
- **Advanced Split Design**: Precisely engineered angle and separation to match natural hand positioning
- **High-Quality Components**: Carefully selected switches, keycaps, and internal electronics for durability and performance
- **Wireless Freedom**: Advanced 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connectivity for a clutter-free workspace
- **Customizable Options**: Multiple switch types, keycap sets, and accessories to match your preferences

## The Science

Our designs are backed by research showing that split keyboards significantly reduce ulnar deviation, shoulder internal rotation, and neck strain. We work with ergonomists to verify that our products provide genuine benefits to users.

## The Team

NXTKB is built by a small but passionate team of keyboard enthusiasts, engineers, and ergonomics advocates who genuinely believe that better keyboards can help people feel better and perform at their peak for years to come.
